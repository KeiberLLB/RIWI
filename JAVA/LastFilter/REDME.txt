Explanation of the proposed solution:

The team with the Scrum Master propose to solve the problem with a Rest full api for coupon discount management by adding accounts to the platform to verify that the same user does not use the same coupon 2 times.

Step by step guide to start up the application:

We expose the problem first then we look at the basic requirements of the application, talk among the team and propose solutions.

We start with the (UML) Task Board and Entity Relationship Model.

We create and designate the tasks for the work team, we begin to make the preparations such as creating the repository, project and download the dependencies.

Once everything is explained and each member knows what we have to do, we start working and the Scrum Master is in charge of verifying the pull request to advance in the project without errors.
